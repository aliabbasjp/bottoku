# bottoku - Python Chat Bot Microframework

bottoku(pronounce like 'bot-oku') is a chat bot *micro* framework for python.

## Feature

bottoku is a microframework, however, you can build chat bots with no limit.

For example,

- Integrates with web framework such as flask, djang, etc...
- Build with AWS Lambda's serverless architecture
- Respond to Line, Facebook, Slack, etc... with one logic!
- Response with image, video, etc...
- Serial conversation: hi! -> how r u? -> great! -> btw, how about...
- Favorite database backend

## Compared to Hubot

- No built-in server, you can build with server / serverless.
- No default binary, integrate by `pip install` ing and use as just a library
- Complicated routing / reply using Python's lambda function

## How to use

First, `pip` it.

```
pip install bottoku
```

Then, well,,, I haven't prepare usage docs yet, see 'example_api'

```
